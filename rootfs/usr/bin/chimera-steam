# Extest is a drop in replacement for the X11 XTEST extension.
# It creates a virtual device with the uinput kernel module.
# It's been primarily developed for allowing the desktop functionality
# on the Steam Controller to work while Steam is open on Wayland.
# Also supports Steam Input as a whole.
